# Bio-Generator

The "Bio Generator" is an Android app that allows users to input their personal information and generates a short bio based on that information. The app consists of two activities, with the first activity presenting input fields for various personal information such as first name, last name, school, year of graduation, degree, major, and favorite activities. The second activity then displays a formatted sentence summarizing the user's information as a short bio. This app is designed to be simple, easy-to-use, and a useful tool for generating a quick personal bio.
